This C++ code implements a classic tic-tac-toe game for two players. A 3x3 grid is used as the game board, on which players take turns marking their moves with 'X' and 'O". The code ensures that players enter valid moves within the boundaries of the board and not already occupied. It checks if a player has filled a row, column or diagonal with his symbol and declares the winner. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw. The game loop allows for multiple rounds and provides the option to restart the game. With a user-friendly text interface, this code provides an interactive and entertaining gaming experience.
